# Google Homepage

This is my first real attempt with HTML and CSSâ€”a clone of the google homepage. 

The project aims to closely resemble google, at least in terms of layout. 

## Installation

This is a web-based project, so no installation is necessary. But to experiment with your own copy of the code, you can use the following:

`git clone path-to-your-repo`

## Usage

If you want to try out my finished project online, it is hosted [here](https://adc17.github.io/google-homepage/) on github.io.
