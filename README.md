This is my first attempt at constructing a proper webpage.

The plan is to recreate the google homepage using html and css (I'm not worrying about javascript, and I'm certainly not worrying about the back end).

If successful, the page will closely resemble google, at least in terms of layout. More importantly, I'll have become much more proficient with HTML and CSS, and I'll have proved it.

The next stop will (I think) be javascript and ruby.
